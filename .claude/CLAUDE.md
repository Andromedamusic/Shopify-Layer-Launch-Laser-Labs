## Continuous Improvement (Kaizen) Process

**IMPORTANT**: Every time we work on this website, we MUST assign 2 subagents to critique the site:

1. **Structure/Construction Critic** - Analyzes:
   - Code organization and architecture
   - UX flow and navigation
   - Information hierarchy
   - Technical implementation quality
   - Performance considerations

2. **Visualization Critic** - Analyzes:
   - Visual design consistency
   - Typography and contrast
   - Color scheme and accessibility
   - Spacing and layout
   - Responsive design quality

This ensures continuous kaizen (improvement) with each addition and inclusion to the website.
